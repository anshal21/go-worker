# go-worker
go-worker provides an implementation of thread pool pattern. It provides the *WorkerPool* interface which exposes following methods

#### Add 
**Add** method adds the provided task to the task queue of workerpool. It takes a **Task** object as input and returns a **Future** object containing the response from the task

#### Start
**Start** method starts the task execution in the workerpool

#### Done
**Done** sends a signal to the workerpool, notifying that no more tasks are to be added to the pool

#### Abort
**Abort** sends a signal to the workerpool, notifying it that further task execution should be aborted

#### WaitForCompletion
**WaitForCompletion** is a blocking method, it waits for all the tasks in the pool to complete the execution before returning
